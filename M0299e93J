-- God Mode Script
-- This script makes the player invulnerable to damage.

-- Function to enable god mode
function enableGodMode(player)
    -- Set the player's health to a very high value
    player.health = math.huge  -- Infinite health
    player.isInvulnerable = true  -- Set invulnerability flag
end

-- Function to disable god mode
function disableGodMode(player)
    player.health = 100  -- Reset health to a default value
    player.isInvulnerable = false  -- Clear invulnerability flag
end

-- Function to handle damage taken by the player
function onPlayerDamage(player, damageAmount)
    if player.isInvulnerable then
        -- If the player is invulnerable, ignore the damage
        print("Damage ignored: Player is in god mode.")
        return 0  -- Return 0 damage
    else
        -- If not invulnerable, apply the damage
        player.health = player.health - damageAmount
        print("Player took damage: " .. damageAmount)
        return damageAmount
    end
end

-- Example usage
local player = {
    health = 100,
    isInvulnerable = false
}

-- Enable god mode for the player
enableGodMode(player)

-- Simulate damage
local damageTaken = onPlayerDamage(player, 50)  -- This should be ignored
print("Player's current health: " .. player.health)  -- Should print "infinite" or a very high number

-- Disable god mode for the player
disableGodMode(player)

-- Simulate damage again
damageTaken = onPlayerDamage(player, 50)  -- This should apply damage
print("Player's current health: " .. player.health)  -- Should print 50
